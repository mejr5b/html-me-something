	  <h2>My Time in the Military</h2>
	  <p>When I was 17, I joined the Army National Guard. I signed up for a 6 year contract. I left for basic training and AIT directly
	  after graduating highschool. For the first two and a half months, I was in South Carolina at Fort Jackson. The remainder of the time I was
	  in Virginia at Fort Lee.
