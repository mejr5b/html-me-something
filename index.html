	   <h2>My Time in the Military</h2>
	   <p>In April 2013, when I was 17, I joined the Army National Guard. I signed up for a 6 year contract. I left for basic training and AIT directly
	   after graduating highschool. For the first two <br> and a half months, I was in South Carolina at Fort Jackson. The remainder of the time I was
	   in Virginia at Fort Lee. At Fort Lee, I went through MOS training for 92Y <br> which means, "Supply Specialist". This training taught me how to control the entire unit's 
	   supply purchasing and inventory. The total inventory for my unit was over $300,000,000. 
	   </p>
	   <h3>Why I Joined</h3>
	   <p>
	   The reason I joined the Guard was because I was not sure what I wanted to major in at college.
	   I knew I wanted to go to college but I was unsure <em>what</em> I wanted to do once I got there.<br> By joining
	   the guard, I was able to take a break between highschool and college. The guard also offered tuition reimbursement.<br><br>
	   Once I graduated from Fort Lee, I then came back to Missouri and was enrolled in 
	   the University of Missouri-Columbia. Also known as the beloved "Mizzou".
